"""
Detector registry.

Maps each anomaly ID (matching the frontend toggle IDs) to a detect function.
Every detect function has the signature:

    detect(video_path: str, model_dir: str) -> list[dict]

and returns a list of event dicts like:
    {"time": 1.23, "confidence": 91.5, "label": "Gunshot"}
